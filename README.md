# Yes-Bank-Stock-Closing-Price-Prediction-by-Regression.

**Project Overview:** This GitHub repository hosts the code and resources for predicting the closing prices of Yes Bank stock. Stock price prediction is a crucial task in the financial world, as accurate forecasts can assist investors and traders in making informed decisions. This project aims to develop a robust predictive model using historical stock data and advanced machine learning techniques.

**Key Features:**
Data Collection: We gather historical stock data of Yes Bank from reliable sources, ensuring quality and accuracy.
Data Preprocessing: The collected data undergoes thorough preprocessing, including handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We analyze the data to gain insights, identify trends, and select relevant features for modeling.

Model Selection: We explore and compare various machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, support vector machines, and deep learning, to determine the best-fit model.

Model Training: The selected model is trained on historical data, optimizing its parameters to achieve the highest predictive accuracy.

Evaluation Metrics: We employ appropriate evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to quantify the model's performance.

Future Scope: As an extension, we might develop a user-friendly web application that provides real-time stock price predictions and visualizations.
